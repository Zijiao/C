serverSNFS.c
Server side program. It contains the server side API
s_open(),s_close(),s_read(),s_write() and s_stat()
To use the server program:
gcc -g -o serverSNFS serverSNFS.c
To run any other programs, run serverSNFS first.
A sample running command line is:
./serverSNFS --port 16892 --mount /tmp/yy291


clientSNFS.c
Client API library (declaration of all APIs are in client_api.h)
It contains functions:
void setServer(char* server,int portnum)
int openFile(char* name);
int closeFile(int fd);
int readFile(int fd, void* buf);
int writeFile(int fd, void* buf);
int statFile(int fd, struct fileStat *buf);
To compile:
gcc -g -o clientapp clientapp.c clientSNFS.c
To use this API library, (for example, program clientapp.c needs to use it):
First run serverSNFS, then open another terminal and run other programs.


clientapp.c
This is the clientapp program.
Run it with the clientSNFS.c in a different terminal window than serverSNFS.
To compile the program:
gcc -g -o clientapp clientapp.c clientSNFS.c


loadtest.c
This is the program for testing the throughput of the server.
The compiling process is similar to clientapp.c.
The program prints throughput for each client process, then you can add them together to get the total throughput for the server.
You can change the source code to measure the throughput with different number of client processes.


test.c
This is the general test program for testing the clientSNFS API.
The compilation is similar to clientapp.c
